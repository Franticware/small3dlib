features:

- presets that can be optionally selected and  will configure other constants
  (e.g. a "low memory sort strategy" will turn z-buffer off and turn
  back-to-front sorting on).

- function for computing normals and lighting

- triangle sorting:
  - back-to-front (slower, better memory efficiency)       DONE
  - front-to-back (faster, but needs 1bit stencil buffer)  DONE

- function to set/clear stencil buffer -- can be useful

- dithered barycentric interpolation function that is faster than normal
  interpolation -- it will randomly picky one of three values, with greater
  probabilities at greater coords

- option to disable baycentric coordinates computing    DONE

- Z-buffer:
  - full                                  DONE
  - reduced (resolution and precision)    DONE
  - more reduced (4-bit)

- MipMapping? Add triangle size to pixelInfo.  DONE

- perspective correction modes:
  - none                                    DONE
  - full                                    DONE
  - triangle subdivision (each triangle side will be subdivided after reaching
    a defined length, which will be measured by Chebyshev or similarly fast
    distance).
  - also offer some approximation function?

- predefined 3D shapes:
  - cube                                    DONE
  - sphere
  - cylinder
  - pyramid
  - plane

- Depth computation during rasterization -- this should be an optional thing,
  specified with a define (S3L_COMPUTE_DEPTH), which may be turned on
  automatically for some modes (e.g. Z-buffer). It should be computed by the
  fast lerp and passed in the PixelInfo struct.    DONE
- Python tool to convert obj to C array            DONE
- helper functions for lighting/shading
- create demos
- drawModel: create an option that would use a cache to not transform the same
  point twice
- Optional rendering stats (FPS, rendered triangles, ...).

bugs:

repeated:

- valgrind (and similar) checks
- optimize
- write tests/benchmarks
